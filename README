matrix_lib_hao
==============

The c++ matrix library, it supports many dimension array and uses lapack blas libaray.
We can use both mkl and acml, with a customed acml.h (not 64, not mp version) header file.


NOTE: To enable MAGMA support, you must use cmake >= 2.8 (or provide
the FindCUDA.cmake module somewhere), and specify `-DUSE_MAGMA=on'
option when running cmake.
